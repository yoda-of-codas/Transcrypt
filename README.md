This is a GUI tool which encrypts and decrypts text and files with the Transpostion Cipher Algorithm
It also includes brute force attack tools for texts and files encrypted with the algorithm

The project also features a window standalone executable with can be easily run by
clicking on the Transcrypt.exe shortcut file. A zip file is also available
You can also run in command line.

The program is also smart enough to detect english with the aid of a dictionary which
can be easily changed by the user if the user wish to use another language for
language detection:: This can be done by changing the Dictionary.txt file 
to another language dictionary also with the name Dictionary.txt.
To make this change for the windows standalone replace the Dictionary.txt file in the /dist/ folder..
